# The Brick Breaker I made
Made for a computer tech class November 29, 2022

It is a colorful game in which you break bricks with a ball that gets steadily faster until it starts smashing through the bricks.

## Implementation
-Blocks Change Colors
-Ball rotates
-Ball color changes with speed
-Hitting blocks causes distortion
-Paddle scale changes depending on how fast you move it
-Indicators rotate and change color with the ball
-Death effect (it looks kinda cool)
-Ball causes colorful distortion when smashing through the bricks
-Zooms in on ball when it reaches peak speed
-Ball does a large red distrotion when it reaches peak speed
